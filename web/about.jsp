                    <h5 class="description">
                        Beginning as a small remodeling company, 
                        husband and wife Emily and Joe started Home Design 
                        Solutions back in 2005. Starting off small, they were 
                        contracted to do work for family and friends that wanted 
                        to upgrade their homes, specifically Bathrooms and Kitchens. T
                        he remodeling of kitchens and bathrooms included taking 
                        measurements and designing new and improved kitchen and 
                        bathroom layouts. </h5>
                    <h5 class="description">
                       This was the AHA moment for Emily and Joe in that they were 
                       able to easily determine that there was an enormous demand  
                       for the type of service they were offering for the greater 
                       Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona area.  
                    </h5>
                    <h5 class="description">
                        After applying and receiving a business license, 
                        Home Design Solutions was officially Emily and Joe?s as 
                        a sole proprietorship operating out of a small store front 
                        they rented at 101 Sedalia Drive, Phoenix, Arizona. 
                        The very first location included some example cabinets and 
                        appliances that they would eventually become regional 
                        distributors for. Being general contractors since 2003, 
                        both Joe and Emily, since then, have hired bath and kitchen 
                        design specialist that have all obtained their own kitchen and 
                        bath design certifications.
