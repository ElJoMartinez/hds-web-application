            <h3>How much will my cabinets cost?</h2>
                <p> Cabinets vary dramatically like cars or houses. Entry-level
                    cabinets are less expensive than cabinets with special 
                    finishes and upgraded storage features. HDS provides 
                    cabinetry that fits most any budget-from basic to bold.

                <h3 class="comment"> How long will it take to get the cabinets I order?</h2>
                    <p> Order time varies depending on the manufacturer and the
                        complexity of the job. The minimum time is roughly three
                        weeks and can be as much as eight weeks during peak times
                        of the year.

                    <h3> Can you design my kitchen from a sketch of the room that I
                        provide?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We can certainly start with a sketch you provide. Your 
                        forethought in doing some homework can shorten the time
                        needed to design the final layout. However, we will always 
                        do our own measurements to verify that the design will 
                        actually work

                        What is the best type of countertop for the kitchen?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        There are many possible countertop choices. As with cabinets,
                        your budget needs to be matched with your desire for
                        flexibility of design and product longevity. Laminate, solid 
                        surface, quartz-enhanced and granite are all good choices.

                    <p>
                        All woods and stains change color over time--some more than
                        others. In many cases, HDS can find cabinetry that may be
                        compaitble with your existing cabinets or furniture. In no 
                        case can we guarantee an exact match.

                    <h3>
                        What construction features should I look for when choosing
                        cabinets?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Certain construction features are a sign of quality 
                        cabinets. A savvy consumer will look for things such as
                        finished backs in all cabinets, drawer guides that also
                        support the drawer bottom, conversion varnish (not lacquer)
                        finishes, multi-way adjustable hinges, adjustable shelves, 
                        and a wide range of heights and depths. Newer convenience
                        features include "soft-close" hinges and drawers, multi-
                        function drawer systems, and optional task lighting.

                        Be sure to check for the KCMA (Kitchen Cabinet 
                        Manufacturers Association) label, a certification that the
                        cabinets meet construction standards designed to ensure many
                        years of trouble-free service.

                    <h3>
                        What are the most popular types of cabinets?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        While popular cabinet styles and trends vary from year
                        to year, traditional raised-panel oak styling is always
                        a favorite due to affordability and and durability. 
                        A current trend is a "stand-alone" furniture look that allows
                        for highly customized design features using cabinetry from
                        major manufacturers.<br />
                        Besides oak, certain wood species tend to be favored by
                        today's consumers. Maple is frequently used in remodeling
                        because of its clean look and its ability to blend in 
                        with most existing finishes. Cherry has become increasingly
                        popular as manufacturers have developed a variety of 
                        finishes allowing it to work in more applications.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Years ago there was a significant difference in the sizes
                        and finishes available from "custom" cabinet makers and the
                        "stock" manufacturers.

                        Do you charge a design free, measure fee or other fees in 
                        addition to the contract price for cabinets and installation?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        HDS does not charge a measure fee or a design fee for a first
                        design or estimate. In some cases, where multiple design 
                        revisions are requested, a design retainer may be requested. 
                        The retainer is then credited in full to the final cost of
                        the job.

                        HDS specializes in "light" kitchen, office, or laundry room
                        remodeling. We have strong working relationships with several
                        quality, full-line remodeling firms for those jobs that 
                        require major structural renovation.

                    <p>
                        HDS works with a number of reputable remodelers and can 
                        provide cabinets through your contractor or directly to your
                        for your kitchen or bath remodeling project or room addition.
                        We also work with many custom home builders, who consult with 
                        our designers to assure that the layouts for the kitchen
                        cabinets, bath cabinets, laundry room cabinets and other
                        cabinetry are chosen to properly fit the budget and space.
                        We will coordinate directly with your builder and also consult
                        directly with you.
